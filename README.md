# Shower Thoughts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my first react app.

It is a simple blog, where you can see shower thoughts from other people and can even post your own for others to see.

I haven't deployed it yet, so I can't provide a link for it yet. But if you want to try it out in your local machine, just follow the below instructions.

## Local Setup Instructions

To run this app, you need to have the latest version of `Node.js`.

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it.

Now, Fork or Clone this repo into your local machine and run the following command in the terminal to download the required dependencies.

### `npm install`

This will download all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

Now that you have everything ready, use the following command to start the app.

### `npm start`

The above command runs the app in the development mode.\
The app automatically redirects you to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), if it doesn't do that, then open that link to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you save any changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the official `create-react-app` docs for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Hooray! Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the official `create-react-app` docs for more information.
